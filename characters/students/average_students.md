## Common Struggles and Setbacks

### Performance Plateaus

- Some struggle with the theoretical jump from practical techniques to circle advancement
- Academic knowledge often outpaces practical application abilities
- Team chemistry issues prevent advancement despite individual talent
- Political conflicts within teams create performance problems

### Psychological Challenges
- Witnessing peers advance rapidly while struggling to improve
- Family pressure for exceptional performance creates anxiety
- Fear of failure after early promise leads to risk aversion
- Comparing oneself to historical prodigies creates unrealistic expectations
- Realizing one's likely career ceiling falls below childhood dreams

### Social Dynamics
- Clear hierarchies form between differently ranked students
- Some lower-ranked students avoid high-achievers out of insecurity
- Others desperately seek mentorship from elite students
- Complicated feelings toward exceptional first-years who outperform upper-years
- Formation of social groups based on shared achievement levels

## Value to Michael and Victoria

### Potential Mentors
- Students with specialized knowledge but poor team dynamics could join Michael's missions
- Underperforming upper-years might eagerly mentor promising first-years for validation
- Average performers often make better teachers than exceptional talents who rely on instinct

### Political Considerations
- Lower-ranked upper-years represent a significant voting bloc within student body
- Showing respect to average performers demonstrates leadership character
- Building relationships across achievement levels creates broader support network
- Understanding common struggles helps avoid appearing elitist or disconnected

### Learning Opportunities
