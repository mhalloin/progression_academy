# Spin-Off Concept: "Imperial Cultivation: Transcendent Realms"

## Core Premise
After stabilizing the empire and implementing reforms, Michael, Victoria, and their core team undertake a daring expedition through the now-partially controlled rift that destroyed the Aurelius homeworld.

What they discover isn't just a hostile dimension but an entirely different civilization with a transcendent cultivation system that renders them novices once again.
