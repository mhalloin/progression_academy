# The Imperial Academy of Cultivation

## Key Academy Features

### Admission Age and Process
- Students begin at 21 years old
- No formal magical education is permitted before this age
- However, high nobility often train informally against mana beasts
- Testing ceremony determines placement and resources

### The Testing Ceremony
- First day evaluation where students channel mana into a device
- Device charges the capital's shields while measuring output
- One-minute test produces a numerical score:
  - Common students: ~500 units
  - Lower nobility: ~2,000-3,000 units
  - Higher nobility: ~6,000 units
  - Exceptional talents (Michael/Victoria): ~12,000 units
- Results determine student rankings, resources, course placement
- Attended by scouts from noble families looking for talent

### Campus Design and Legacy
- Buildings named after distinguished alumni rather than donors
- Aurelius Innovation Center named after Michael's father
- Laurent Spire central training tower named after Victoria's great-grandfather
- The Valorian Arena named after a legendary general
- Historical collections of original manuscripts and artifacts
- Architecture showcasing cultivation principles in physical form

### Hierarchy and Resources
- Students ranked by magical ability
- Top 20 students assigned to advanced combat courses

- Highest ranked students (Michael/Victoria) receive private dorms on top floor
- Resource allocation reflects both talent and political standing

## Social Environment

### Elite Perception
- To commoners and distant systems, any Imperial Academy degree is prestigious
- Graduates command automatic respect in provincial settings
- Internal hierarchies create complex status dynamics
- Faculty perpetuating hierarchies through resource allocation
- Constant status signaling between schools during shared activities

### Michael's Reception
- Initially assigned to common dormitories through Nevarrin machination
- High nobility publicly distancing themselves from his fallen status
- Lower nobility ostentatiously snubbing him to prove loyalty
- Common students maintaining distance to avoid appearing aligned with him
- Gradual recruitment of talented commoners despite opposition

### Victoria's Position
- Excessive deference creates social barrier
- Students competing to show respect rather than form connection
- Measured, formal demeanor misinterpreted as coldness
- Students outraged when Michael scores near her level
- Active attempts to prevent their association despite shared tower

### Faculty Politics
- Professors may have allegiances to noble families
- Student rivalries often reflect larger political tensions
- Victoria has authority to dismiss instructors (demonstrated after the 3v1 duel)
- Seraphina's appointment changing academy dynamics
- Theoretical instructors generally more politically neutral
