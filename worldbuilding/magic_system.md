# Magic System

## Core Mechanics
- **Mana**: The fundamental energy source for all magical abilities
  - Concentrated in "Mana Wells" around which civilizations are built
  - Can be absorbed through meditation in areas with ambient mana
  - More powerful practitioners can channel greater amounts of mana

- **Runic Weapons**: Physical manifestation of magical progression
  - Practitioners engrave runic patterns onto weapons or items
  - Quality of the base item affects potential power and efficiency
  - Legacy weapons passed down through generations
  - Pre-made weapons with "blank" circles for future inscription
  - Soul binding allows deeper connection to one's runic weapon

- **Progression Path**: Cultivation-style advancement
  - Practitioners gain power through meditation and runic engraving
  - Training involves both internal mana development and external weapon inscription
  - Early training against mana beasts accelerates development
  - Formal education begins at the Magic Academy at age 21

- **Measurement**: Power can be quantified
  - Academy testing measures mana output in numerical terms
  - Common students: ~500 units
  - Lower nobility: ~2,000-3,000 units
  - Higher nobility: ~6,000 units
  - Exceptional talents (Michael/Victoria): ~12,000 units

## Special Techniques

- **Soul Binding**: Ancient and powerful technique
  - Can connect two individuals' life forces
  - Allows one to sustain the other in case of critical injury
  - Creates a permanent bond that requires physical proximity
  - Considered more binding than traditional marriage under magical law

- **Teleportation**: Advanced magic developed by Aurelius family
  - Enables instantaneous travel between star systems
  - Requires significant infrastructure (teleportation gates)
  - Limited by capacity unless specifically designed otherwise

## House Specializations

- **House Laurent**: Light-based projection techniques
  - Rapiers as precision magical conduits
  - Blinding illumination and perception enhancement
  - Microscopic runic work requiring magnification to appreciate

- **House Aurelius**: Spatial manipulation techniques
  - Slender longswords as magical foci
  - Teleportation and dimensional effects
  - Intricate micro-runic patterns with technological application

- **House Nevarrin**: Physical enhancement techniques
  - Large battleaxes and greatswords for traditional combat
  - Body and weapon reinforcement over external projection
  - Bold macro-runic patterns visible from a distance

- **House Thorne**: Elemental communion techniques
  - Ancient staves and ceremonial blades with traditional patterns
  - Ritual purification enhancing elemental access
  - Classical runic patterns unchanged for generations

- **House Veracruz**: Combat optimization techniques
  - Versatile dueling sabers with adaptable configurations
  - Balanced approach between projection and enhancement
  - Efficient military-focused runic designs

- **House Azemar**: Esoteric scholarly techniques
  - Concealed runic tools (fans, jewelry, hidden weapons)
  - Subtle effects focused on perception and environment
  - Secretive patterns often hidden within ornamental designs

## Magical Combat
- Formal dueling appears to be an accepted practice
- Combat magic can be lethal if not controlled
- Academy teaches advanced combat techniques to top students

## Runic Inscription Tools

### Traditional Methods
- **Will Sharpening**: Meditation technique to focus mental energy for inscription
- **Direct Channeling**: Using pure will to carve runic patterns without tools
- **Manual Tools**: Basic physical implements for larger runic work
- **Visualization Techniques**: Mental practices to perfect patterns before inscription
- **Foundational Exercises**: Standard training to develop necessary precision

### The Soul Needle
- **Aurelius Innovation**: Revolutionary tool developed by Michael's father
- **Function**: Allows microscopic precision runic inscription impossible with traditional methods
- **Storage**: Exists partially in user's soul space when not in active use
- **Self-Inscription**: Contains foundational runes on the needle itself
- **Efficiency**: Minimizes mana wastage during runic inscription process
- **Controversy**: Considered "cheating" by traditionalists despite superior results
- **Rarity**: Original design shared only with imperial family as diplomatic gesture
- **Replication Attempts**: Other houses created inferior versions lacking soul-space integration
- **Usage Impact**: Users may neglect developing traditional skills due to tool advantage

### House-Specific Approaches
- **Laurent**: Combination of soul needle and traditional training for balanced approach
- **Aurelius**: Soul needle-focused with emphasis on efficiency and innovation
- **Nevarrin**: Mass-produced physical tools with standardized patterns
- **Thorne**: Purely traditional methods rejecting all artificial aids
- **Veracruz**: Practical compromise with limited tool use for military applications
- **Azemar**: Secretive esoteric methods combining multiple approaches

## Physical Transformation
- **Beautification**: Cultivation causes practitioners to become inhumanly beautiful
  - Process begins with first circle completion and advances with each level
  - Features become more refined, symmetrical, and perfect
  - Skin develops subtle luminosity visible especially in dim light
  - Movement becomes naturally graceful and efficient
  - Aging process dramatically slows or halts entirely

- **House Variations**: Different noble traditions affect transformation
  - Laurent: Luminous quality with distinctive eye patterns
  - Aurelius: Perfect proportional harmony and star-like eyes
  - Nevarrin: Robust beauty with earthen tones and metallic highlights
  - Thorne: Classical aesthetics following ancient imperial ideals
  - Veracruz: Warrior beauty emphasizing controlled power
  - Azemar: Ethereal, otherworldly qualities with unusual subtlety

- **Social Implications**:
  - Common-born students become visibly different from their communities
  - Beauty creates both admiration and jealousy from non-practitioners
  - Obvious visual marker of cultivator status visible to ordinary people
  - Can lead to ostracism when common students return home
  - Creates additional layer to existing class divides
