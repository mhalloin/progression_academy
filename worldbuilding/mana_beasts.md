# Mana Beasts and Mana Wells

## Mana Well Classification

### Overview
Mana wells are massive concentrations of magical energy, often corresponding with celestial bodies such as stars. They radiate mana to surrounding planets, creating habitable environments for both human cultivation and unfortunately, mana beast proliferation. The Imperial Classification System categorizes mana wells on a five-tier scale based on output, stability, and radius of influence.

### Tier Classification System

#### Tier 1 Wells
- **Output**: Minimal mana radiation, supporting basic cultivation only
- **Stability**: Often fluctuating, with occasional dormant periods
- **Radius**: Limited to immediate planetary body, minimal spread
- **Settlement Level**: Frontier outposts, minimal infrastructure
- **Beast Threat**: Low-level creatures, manageable by local militia
- **Imperial Presence**: Monitoring stations with rotation of junior cultivators
- **Known Locations**: Numerous minor systems in outer territories

#### Tier 2 Wells
- **Output**: Modest mana production supporting up to fourth-circle cultivation
- **Stability**: Generally stable with predictable seasonal variations
- **Radius**: Extends to nearby planets within system
- **Settlement Level**: Secondary noble houses, moderate infrastructure
- **Beast Threat**: Regular emergence requiring quarterly clearance operations
- **Imperial Presence**: Permanent garrison with rapid response capabilities
- **Known Locations**: House Nevarrin ancestral system, numerous secondary territories

#### Tier 3 Wells

### Distribution and Rarity
- Tier 1-2: Relatively common, comprising 70% of known mana wells
- Tier 3: Uncommon, approximately 20% of known wells
- Tier 4: Rare, approximately 8% of known wells
- Tier 5: Extremely rare, less than 2% of known wells

### Political Significance
- Control of higher-tier wells represents significant political power
- Noble houses historically established around significant wells
- Imperial authorization required for settlement near tier 4-5 wells
- Resource competition primarily centered on access to well output
- Teleportation gate network prioritizes connection to higher-tier wells

## Mana Beast Ecology

### Origin and Nature
- Mana beasts are not conventional organic creatures but manifestations of mana
- They emerge spontaneously in areas with sufficient ambient mana
- Require continuous mana absorption to maintain form and function
- Eventually develop physical bodies that house concentrated mana cores
- Evolution accelerates in proportion to available mana concentration
- Possess natural affinity for specific mana characteristics (elemental, spatial, etc.)
- Drawn instinctively toward greater mana concentrations

### Lifecycle
- **Genesis**: Spontaneous formation in mana-rich environments
- **Coalescence**: Development of physical form around mana nucleus
- **Maturation**: Growth and development of specialized abilities
- **Adaptation**: Environmental specialization based on available mana
- **Reproduction**: Splitting/budding rather than conventional reproduction
- **Core Formation**: Development of concentrated mana crystal within body
- **Evolution**: Continuous advancement if sufficient mana is available

### Hierarchy and Classification

#### Size Categories
- **Minuscule**: 10-50cm, common in all mana environments
- **Small**: 0.5-2m, standard threat in tier 1-2 wells
- **Medium**: 2-10m, dominant in tier 2-3 wells
- **Large**: 10-50m, prevalent in tier 3-4 wells
- **Massive**: 50-200m, found in tier 4-5 wells
- **Colossal**: 200-1000m, rare even in tier 5 wells
- **Leviathan**: 1km+, legendary threats requiring imperial intervention

#### Threat Classifications
- **D-Class**: Minimal threat, suitable for trainee hunters
- **C-Class**: Standard threat requiring trained hunters
- **B-Class**: Significant threat requiring specialized teams
- **A-Class**: Major threat requiring coordinated operations
- **S-Class**: Critical threat requiring elite hunter intervention
- **SS-Class**: Exceptional threat requiring imperial assets
- **SSS-Class**: Catastrophic threat requiring multiple elite teams

#### Specialization Types
- **Elemental**: Affinity for specific elemental mana
- **Physical**: Enhanced physical capabilities through mana reinforcement
- **Spatial**: Limited teleportation or dimensional manipulation
- **Psychic**: Mental influence or perception manipulation
- **Adaptive**: Rapid evolution based on environmental challenges
- **Composite**: Multiple specializations in mature specimens
- **Ancient**: Extremely old specimens with unique abilities

### Territorial Behavior
- Establish territories around mana sources
- Hierarchical dominance based on mana absorption capability
- Stronger specimens claim areas closer to mana well centers
- Territorial disputes common when mana levels fluctuate
- Migration patterns follow seasonal mana fluctuations
- Mass migrations possible when attracted to new mana sources
- Growing populations create pressure toward human settlements

## Imperial Monitoring and Defense

### Beast Detection Systems
- **Orbital Scanners**: Network monitoring mana concentrations
- **Early Warning Arrays**: Detecting unusual beast activity
- **Deep Space Monitors**: Watching for leviathan-class threats
- **Scout Vessels**: Regular patrols of known beast territories
- **Cultivator Sensors**: Specialized sensing techniques
- **Historical Mapping**: Tracking of migration and emergence patterns
- **Automated Alert System**: Classification and notification protocol

### Defense Infrastructure
- **Planetary Barriers**: Runic formations preventing beast incursion
- **Hunter Outposts**: Forward bases for rapid response
- **Cultivation Academies**: Training centers for beast hunters
- **Core Processing Facilities**: Extraction and utilization of harvested cores
- **Military Vessels**: Specialized ships for space-borne threats
- **Emergency Evacuation Systems**: Protocols for civilian protection
- **Elite Hunter Corps**: Specialized divisions for high-level threats

### Interstellar Threat Response
- Space-borne mana beasts represent greatest threat to travel
- Teleportation gates include beast detection and elimination systems
- Regular patrol routes maintained between settled systems
- Emergency response fleets stationed at strategic locations
- Mandatory reporting of all beast sightings during transit
- Specialized military vessels designed for beast hunting
- Interception protocols for approaching leviathan-class entities

## Academy Mission Integration

### Mission Classification System
- Mission difficulty directly correlates with beast threat level
- Geographic distance from mana wells affects mission ranking
- Regular "culling" missions to prevent population growth
- Special research missions studying unusual specimens
- Emergency response for unexpected migrations or mutations
- Long-term monitoring of known beast territories
- Advanced missions investigating leviathan sightings

### Training Progression
- First-year students: D-class beasts in controlled environments
- Second-year students: C-class beasts in mapped territories
- Third-year students: B-class beasts in less stable regions
- Fourth-year students: A-class beasts under faculty supervision
- Fifth-year specialists: S-class threats with elite hunter support
- Graduates joining hunter corps: Regular management operations
- Elite specialists: Responding to exceptional threats

### Core Harvesting Economy
- Beast cores as primary cultivation resource
- Core quality directly proportional to beast's age and mana absorption
- Sophisticated extraction techniques to maximize core integrity
- Processing facilities converting raw cores to usable formats
- Commercial market for standard cores with regulated pricing
- Restricted trade of exceptional cores from higher-class beasts
- House monopolies on certain beast territories creating economic leverage

## Historical Perspective
