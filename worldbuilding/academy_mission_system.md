# Academy Mission System

## Overview
The Imperial Academy of Cultivation integrates practical field experience with theoretical education through a structured mission system. Students alternate between campus instruction and field missions throughout the academic year, creating a cyclical learning pattern that develops both theoretical knowledge and practical application.

## Academic Schedule Structure

### Cyclical Format
- **Campus Month**: Four weeks of theoretical instruction, runic training, and laboratory work
- **Field Month**: Four weeks of mission deployment, transit, and practical application
- **Full Cycle**: Eight weeks from start of campus period to return from field
- **Annual Pattern**: Six complete cycles per academic year
- **Progression**: Mission difficulty increases with each cycle and year

### Cycle Breakdown
- **Week 1-4**: Campus-based theoretical instruction and practice
- **Week 5**: Transit to designated mission territory
- **Week 6-7**: Active mission operations and core harvesting
- **Week 8**: Return transit and preliminary reporting
- **Following Cycle Begin**: Formal debriefing and academic integration of field experiences
