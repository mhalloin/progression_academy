# House Aurelius: Historical Vassal Houses

House Aurelius, once one of the great high noble houses of the Empire, maintained a network of vassal houses that specialized in different aspects of spatial technology and research. The destruction of the Aurelius home system resulted in the near-extinction of these vassal houses, with only scattered survivors remaining.

## Primary Vassal Houses

### House Starmind (Research Focus)
- **Specialty**: Theoretical spatial physics and advanced runic applications
- **Historical Role**: Served as the premier research division directly under Arcturus Aurelius (Michael's father)
- **Known For**: Pioneered the "Convergent Dimensional Theorem" that revolutionized spatial rune efficiency
- **Destruction**: Research headquarters destroyed; ~95% casualty rate
- **Survivors**: Primarily researchers who were presenting at conferences or stationed at satellite facilities
- **Current Status**: A few survivors maintain their research in secret, most notably Lyra Starmind at the Imperial Academy

### House Vaultguard
- **Specialty**: Protection of Aurelius artifacts and spatial technology
- **Historical Role**: Secured the family's most valuable relics and technological secrets
- **Known For**: Unparalleled security systems using spatial displacement technology
- **Destruction**: Primary security complex obliterated; ~98% casualty rate
- **Survivors**: A handful of security specialists who were escorting important artifacts off-world
- **Current Status**: Survivors have gone into hiding or taken security positions with other houses

### House Riftwarden
- **Specialty**: Practical applications of spatial combat techniques
- **Historical Role**: Elite combat unit trained in Aurelius spatial fighting methods
- **Known For**: Distinctive fighting style combining spatial manipulation with precise bladework
- **Destruction**: Training facilities and command structure eliminated; ~97% casualty rate
- **Survivors**: Three master combatants who were serving as trainers in imperial special forces
- **Current Status**: Remaining members have integrated into imperial military structure while maintaining their unique combat techniques

## Current Status of Survivors

Most survivors exist in a precarious position:
- Many have been absorbed into other houses as specialists without their former status
- Some maintain a quiet loyalty to the Aurelius name but cannot openly support Michael
- A few may be in hiding, fearful that whatever destroyed House Aurelius might target survivors
- All have lost their wealth, political standing, and most of their family connections

## Narrative Implications

1. **Isolated Inheritance**: Michael inherits the Aurelius name but without the traditional support structure other great house heirs take for granted

2. **Hidden Allies**: Throughout the story, Michael could discover surviving Aurelius vassals in unexpected positions, creating moments of recognition and potential alliance

3. **Knowledge Fragments**: Each survivor might hold pieces of Aurelius knowledge or technology, but the complete picture has been shattered

4. **Contrast with Other Houses**: This stark difference in support structure creates a clear disadvantage for Michael compared to other great house heirs with their intact vassal networks

5. **Mystery Elements**: The scattered survivors might hold clues to what actually happened to destroy the Aurelius system, feeding into the larger mystery

## Notable Survivors

### Lyra Starmind
- **Current Position**: Third-year student at the Imperial Academy (Research Track)
- **Background**: Daughter of Elias Starmind, who was Arcturus Aurelius's chief theoretical researcher
- **Pre-Academy**: Completed her three-year transitional apprenticeship (ages 18-21) in her family's research division under her father's guidance
- **Key Experience**: Participated in the landmark "Folded Space Initiative" research project personally overseen by Arcturus Aurelius
- **Survival**: Was already at the Academy when the Aurelius system was destroyed; her parents had sent her specifically to continue their research legacy in a secure location
- **Current Research**: Quietly continues her family's work while maintaining a deliberately low political profile
