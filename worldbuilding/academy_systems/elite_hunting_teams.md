# Academy Elite Hunting Teams

## Overview
Elite Hunting Teams represent the highest level of student mission groups at the Imperial Academy. These specialized teams, predominantly comprised of upper-year students, tackle the most challenging and prestigious missions while serving as aspirational examples for first and second-year students.

## Team Structure and Formation

### Evolution from Standard Teams
- **First Year**: Students assigned to balanced 5-person teams by administration

- Team members must maintain minimum individual reputation level
- At least one member must achieve Third Circle cultivation

### Composition
- **Standard Size**: 4-6 members, typically led by a fourth-year student
- **Track Diversity**: Most successful teams include multiple tracks (combat, research, technical)
- **Specialized Roles**: Each member typically develops a specialized function
- **House Balance**: Some teams form along house lines, others deliberately diversify

## Reputation and Ranking

### Individual Reputation Ranks
1. **Iron** - Starting rank for all students
