# Academy Identification Badge System

## Overview
The Imperial Academy uses a sophisticated identification badge system that passively displays a student's cultivation level, house affiliation, academic track, and reputation rank. These badges serve both practical and social functions, creating immediate visual recognition of status within the academy hierarchy.

## Badge Components

### Base Design
- **Size/Shape**: Circular medallion approximately 2 inches in diameter
- **Material**: Corresponds to reputation rank
  - Bronze → Silver → Gold → Platinum → Diamond
- **Center Emblem**: House crest with distinctive elements
- **Outer Ring**: Visible markers indicating cultivation circle level
- **Track Symbol**: Small icon below center emblem showing academic specialization

### House Affiliation Indicators

#### Great House Main Line Representatives
- Family crest displayed in their distinctive house color:
  - **House Laurent**: Pure white crest with sun symbol
  - **House Thorne**: Royal purple crest with ancient tree
  - **House Nevarrin**: Rust red crest with mountain and crossed pickaxes
  - **House Veracruz**: Forest green crest with crossed sabers
  - **House Azemar**: Navy blue crest with open book and stars
  - **House Aurelius**: Deep crimson crest with geometric gate pattern

#### Vassal Houses
- House's own symbol with a small silver crest of their sponsoring great house in the upper corner
- Example: House Blackthorn's badge shows their own crest with a small silver Thorne tree emblem
- Creates immediate visual linkage between vassal and great house
- If political affiliations change, the silver sponsor crest is updated accordingly

#### Unaffiliated Students
- Display the Imperial insignia in bronze instead of a house crest
- Common-born students and those without formal house alignment use this designation
- Sometimes viewed as a status marker, other times as a badge of merit-based achievement

### Cultivation Level Display
The outer ring contains permanent markers showing cultivation level:
- **First Circle**: Single raised marker at top position (12 o'clock)
- **Second Circle**: Two raised markers at top and bottom (12 and 6 o'clock)
- **Third Circle**: Three raised markers in triangle formation (12, 4, and 8 o'clock)
- **Fourth Circle**: Four raised markers in cross formation (12, 3, 6, and 9 o'clock)
- **Fifth Circle**: Five markers in pentagon formation
- **Sixth Circle**: Six markers in hexagon formation

Progress within a circle is shown through color gradient filling between markers:
- **Early Stage**: Empty between markers
- **Middle Stage**: Halfway filled between markers
- **Late Stage**: Fully filled between markers

The markers and gradient fill naturally glow with the mage's characteristic energy color, visible to everyone without requiring activation.

### Academic Track Symbols
Small icons beneath the center emblem indicate specialization:
- **Combat Track**: Crossed swords
- **Research Track**: Open book
- **Administrative Track**: Quill and scroll
- **Technical Track**: Hammer and tool
- **Medical Track**: Healing staff

### Special Designations
- **Student Council**: Small laurel wreath encircling the track symbol
- **Team Leaders**: Star symbol beside track icon
- **Special Certifications**: Small supplementary symbols around lower edge of badge
- **Academic Honors**: Distinctive runic pattern visible along inner ring

## Information Access

### Visual Information (Visible to Anyone)
- Cultivation circle level through marker configuration
- Reputation rank through badge material

### Runic Information (RFID-like Scan Access)
When scanned by authorized personnel (professors, administrators, security):
- Complete student profile with detailed metrics
- Mission history and performance evaluations
- Academic record and specializations

- Access permissions for restricted areas

Different access levels exist:
- **Students**: Can scan peer badges for basic information
