# Academy Mission and Core Harvesting Systems

## Core Harvesting Mechanics

### Physical Characteristics
- Most mana beast cores are small, marble-sized crystalline structures
- Core size varies with the beast's power level (pea-sized for minor beasts, golf ball for apex predators)
- Color and energy signature reflects the beast's elemental affinity
- Quality varies based on beast's health, age, and the precision of extraction
- Cores begin degrading immediately after extraction, requiring proper storage

### Extraction Process
- Cores must be extracted quickly after defeating a mana beast
- Precision extraction techniques dramatically impact core quality
- Most mages can perform basic extraction, but specialized techniques yield better results
- Damaged or shattered cores lose significant value

### Core Storage and Transport
- Mages can temporarily store harvested cores within their own core
- Average Second Circle cultivator can carry 10-15 beast cores internally
- Prolonged internal storage slowly integrates the core's energy with the mage's own
- Special containment devices used for long-term storage or large quantities
- Energy leakage during transport is a common problem requiring technical solutions

## Core Utilization Options

### Personal Advancement
- Cores can be processed by the mage to enhance their own cultivation
- Processing requires time, concentration, and specialized techniques
- Different beast types provide different cultivation benefits
- Processing multiple cores from the same beast type creates diminishing returns
- Complete processing can take several days for higher-quality cores

### Academy Exchange System
- Students can submit cores to the academy in exchange for merit points
- Merit points can be used to access academy resources:
  - Equipment and supplies
  - Private training facilities
  - Advanced technique manuals
  - Priority mission selection
  - Specialized instruction
- Exchange rates vary based on core quality, rarity, and current demand
- Market fluctuations can significantly impact core values

### The Critical Tradeoff
- Every core represents a choice: personal power or academy resources
- Common-born students often forced to exchange most cores for basic necessities
- Wealthy students can focus on processing cores for personal advancement
- This creates a systemic advantage in cultivation progression
- Students who consistently exchange cores fall behind in personal power

## Academy Expedition Options

### School-Sponsored Expeditions
- Organized monthly for all eligible students
- Highly structured with strict supervision by academy staff
- Safe, heavily-hunted territories with depleted beast populations
- Large student-to-beast ratio limiting individual opportunities
- Primarily designed for first-year and lower-ranked students
- Basic equipment provided by the academy
- Standard transport with predictable schedules
- Minimal core yield due to competition and depleted hunting grounds
- Free to participate but yields limited returns

### Military Joint Operations
- Organized by Imperial Military on quarterly schedule
- Priority access given to military-affiliated noble houses
- Secondary access for unaffiliated students based on reputation rank
- Transportation provided on military schedule to frontier territories
- More dangerous with moderate beast density
- Requires students to share yields with military escorts
- Limited openings requiring early application
- Better yield than school expeditions but sub-optimal hunting grounds
- Cost-effective but with significant time constraints

### Private Expeditions
- Accessible primarily to noble houses with private resources
- Requires private transportation to premium hunting grounds
- Optimal timing based on beast migration and breeding patterns
- Access to restricted territories with abundant high-quality beasts
- Freedom to select ideal targets and extraction timing
- Specialized equipment for optimal core preservation
- Exponentially higher yield compared to standard expeditions
- Enormous cost barrier effectively excluding common-born students

## Noble Sponsorship Benefits

### For Sponsored Students
- Access to private transportation for hunting expeditions
- Entry into restricted, resource-rich territories
- High-quality equipment for optimal core extraction
- Financial support allowing focus on processing cores rather than exchanging them
- Private training facilities with optimized cultivation environments
- Family techniques that maximize core processing efficiency
- Networks providing information about prime hunting opportunities

### For Sponsoring Nobles
- Talented students provide additional core harvesting capacity
- Loyalty and service from sponsored students
- Broader house representation in tournament competitions
- Future assets for house operations after graduation
- Political influence through expanded patronage networks
- Talent identification and recruitment opportunities

## Systemic Challenges for Common-Born Students

### The Resource Trap
- Must exchange cores for basic necessities and equipment
- Limited access to quality hunting grounds
- Restricted to school-sponsored and occasional military expeditions
- Significant time spent waiting for expedition opportunities
- Less efficient core processing techniques
- Forced to concentrate on immediate needs rather than long-term advancement
- Constantly falling further behind resource-rich peers despite equal talent

### Breaking the Cycle
- Exceptional performance required to attract noble sponsors
- First-year tournament success critical for recognition
- Resource pooling among common-born teams provides limited advantages
- Innovation in technique can partially offset resource disadvantages
- Specialization in overlooked beast types or territories offers opportunities
- Academy merit scholarships exist but are extremely competitive
- Joint ventures with lower nobility create mutual benefits
