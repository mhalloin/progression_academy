# World Overview

## Setting Type
An alternative universe combining elements of cultivation/progression fantasy with a space opera setting.

## Core World Elements
- **Mana Wells**: Massive sources of magical energy around which civilizations are built
  - Classified on 5-tier scale from minimal to supreme output
  - Create ambient mana allowing practitioners to progress through meditation
  - Generate mana beasts attracted to mana concentrations
  - The imperial capital orbits a Tier-5 mana well, the largest known source
  - Former Aurelius homeworld also orbited a Tier-5 well
  - Noble house territories centered around higher-tier wells (Tier 2-4)

- **Interstellar Empire**: Spans multiple star systems, ruled by the Empress (Victoria's mother)
  - Connected through teleportation gates created by the Aurelius family
  - Highly class-stratified society
  - Constant vigilance against mana beast threats

- **Magic Academy**: Elite educational institution that only accepts students at age 21
  - Training ground for the empire's future leaders and powerful practitioners
  - Features combat training, magical assessment, and specialized courses
  - Regular mission cycles for beast hunting and core harvesting
  - Becomes the central location for much of the story

## Social Structure
- **Imperial Family**: Highest authority, led by the Empress
  - Traditionally matrilineal succession, with Victoria expected to succeed her mother
  - Empire has slight matriarchal leaning due to imperial influence but varies by house
  - Female rulers more common but not universal across imperial territories

- **High Nobility**: Control entire star systems, report directly to the Empress
  - Six major houses with distinct cultivation styles and political alignments
  - House Laurent (Imperial Family): Light-based techniques, white coloration
  - House Aurelius (Michael's Family): Spatial manipulation, crimson coloration
  - House Nevarrin (Industrial Upstarts): Physical enhancement, rust red coloration
  - House Thorne (Ancient Traditionalists): Elemental communion, royal purple coloration
  - House Veracruz (Military Dynasty): Combat optimization, forest green coloration
  - House Azemar (Isolationist Scholars): Esoteric techniques, navy blue coloration

- **Low Nobility**: Control planets or significant resources
  - Report to high noble factions that control their system
  - Can be elevated through service to high nobles or the imperial family
  - More diverse leadership styles and succession practices

- **Commoners**: Lowest class with limited access to resources and training

## Technology
- **Teleportation Gates**: Created by the Aurelius family
  - Allow instantaneous travel between star systems
  - Massive fixed installations requiring enormous mana resources
  - Limited access granted primarily to imperial family and Aurelius interests
  - Create near-permanent connection between linked systems

- **FTL Ships**: Based on same fundamental technology as teleportation
  - Miniaturized, mobile versions of spatial manipulation technology
  - All FTL drives require Aurelius-patented components and imperial licensing
  - Much slower than teleportation (took Michael six months to reach imperial capital)
  - Significantly less efficient and more expensive per unit transported
  - Ship production restricted to imperial shipyards through regulation

- **Transportation Monopoly**: Complete Aurelius control of interstellar travel
  - Premium teleportation for highest-value goods and persons
  - "Standard" FTL shipping for everything else, still requiring Aurelius licensing
  - Creates two-tier transportation system with vast economic implications

- **Advanced Weaponry**: Includes dreadnoughts and other military technology
  - Proved ineffective against the interdimensional threat

## Economic System
- **Imperial Capital Markets**: Sophisticated financial exchanges
  - Real-time trading for those with teleportation access
  - Creates significant information and investment advantages
  - Deep liquidity pools available primarily to imperial and Aurelius interests

- **Two-Tier Market Access**:
  - Aurelius world: Real-time access through permanent teleportation connection
  - Other high noble worlds: Delayed access with information lag of hours to days
  - Frontier worlds: Potentially weeks of delay making sophisticated trading impossible

- **Corporate Migration Pattern**:
  - Successful companies from other territories relocating to imperial capital or Aurelius homeworld
  - Wealth generated flowing primarily to imperial capital markets
  - Creates "innovation colonies" where ideas originate but profits flow elsewhere

- **Shipping Industry Dynamics**:
  - Powerful shipping houses like Starfarer Logistics thriving due to restricted teleportation access
  - Shipping companies serving routes without teleportation gates at premium rates
  - Complex economic ecosystem dependent on current transportation limitations
  - Some lower noble houses building significant wealth through interstellar logistics

## Threats

- **Mana Beasts**: Constant and ever-present danger to civilization
  - Spontaneously form in mana-rich environments and are attracted to mana sources
  - Grow larger and more powerful with age and mana consumption
  - Range from small D-class threats to massive leviathan-class entities
  - Require continuous hunting and population control
  - Can grow large enough to threaten spacecraft in deep space
  - Imperial defense systems monitor beast populations and migrations
  - Mission system primarily focused on managing beast threat

- **Interdimensional Monsters**: Unknown entities that emerged through a rift
  - Destroyed the Aurelius homeworld
  - Pose a potential existential threat to the entire empire
  - Empire is preparing for their potential arrival
  - May have connection to ancient mana beasts
