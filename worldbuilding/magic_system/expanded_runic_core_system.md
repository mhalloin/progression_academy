# The Expanded Runic Core System

## Core Mechanics

### External Mana and Runic Carving
When practitioners attempt to carve new runes on their core:

- **Fully Charged Core**: Their own core must be at maximum capacity, creating a firm "surface" for inscription
- **External Mana Stream**: They channel external mana as the "carving tool" to inscribe new patterns
- **Resistance Balance**: Without external mana, the core would either resist too strongly (preventing precision) or collapse inward (creating malformed runes)

This creates a physical dependency on external mana sources, directly tying cultivation advancement to resource access.

### Circle Advancement Requirements
Each new circle requires:

- **Expanded Core Capacity**: Both physical size and mana density must increase
- **Higher Quality External Mana**: More refined, concentrated sources needed for precision work
- **More Complex Runic Sequences**: Each circle adds exponentially more intricate patterns
- **Longer Carving Sessions**: Advanced circles might require days or weeks of continuous work

This naturally creates social stratification, as only those with resources can meet these escalating requirements.

## The Sacrificial Core System

### The Desperate Choice
For most commoners:

- They possess the same innate potential as anyone else at birth
- Faced with economic necessity, they make a devastating choice
- They carve crude, damaging runes that permanently harm their core
- These rudimentary inscriptions allow them to harvest minimal mana
- The damage is irreversible, limiting them to crystal farming for life
- This choice is made with full awareness of the consequences

This creates a society where inequality isn't just economic but physically inscribed into people's bodies.

### The Parental Sacrifice Cycle
This system creates powerful family dynamics:

- Parents permanently damage their cores to provide for their children
- They save every crystal possible for years, sometimes decades
- All hope is placed on children receiving proper foundation training
- Enormous pressure is placed on children to "make the sacrifice worth it"
- If the child fails to qualify for advancement, the family faces both economic disaster and profound emotional trauma

### Damaged Core Economy
This creates a stratified working class:

- **Harvesters**: Those with crudely carved cores who can only collect raw mana
- **Refiners**: Those with slightly better cores who process raw mana into usable forms
- **Crafters**: Those with functional but limited cores who create basic mana items
- **Technicians**: Those who failed formal academy training but have useful incomplete cores

## Mana Crystal Currency

### Crystal Farming
The lowest level of cultivation involvement:

- Base practitioners channel ambient mana into crystals through repetitive, labor-intensive processes
- Crystal quality varies based on harvester's skill and local mana density
- These mana crystals serve as both currency and cultivation resources
- Families save crystals for years to give their children a chance at advancement
- The mana crystal economy forms the foundation of imperial commerce

### Regional Disparities
Crystal farming varies dramatically by region:

- **Imperial Core Systems**: Dense, high-quality ambient mana makes crystal farming more productive
- **Aurelius System**: Secondary mana well with unique spatial properties creating specialized crystals
- **Standard Noble Systems**: Moderate mana density requiring significant labor for minimal yield
- **Fringe Systems**: Sparse ambient mana except near dangerous mana beast territories

## Class Differences in Cultivation

### Common Citizens
- Limited access to external mana sources
- Must use ambient mana (weaker, less stable)
- No foundation training before beginning cultivation
- Often resort to sacrificial cores out of economic necessity
- Results: Misaligned runes, inefficient patterns, limited potential

### Lower Nobility
- Access to moderate mana sources
- Basic foundation training
- Some family runic patterns, though often outdated
- Can afford proper core development without sacrifice
- Results: Functional but unremarkable runic arrays

### High Nobility
- Private access to mana wells
- Comprehensive childhood foundation training before first inscription
- Expert instructors guiding each runic carving session
- Ancestral runic patterns optimized over generations
- Results: Exceptionally harmonized runic arrays with maximized efficiency

### Imperial Family
- Direct access to the empire's primary mana well
- Royal runic patterns incorporating ancient imperial techniques
- Training from the empire's most accomplished runic masters
- Victoria born with partial first circle already formed (unprecedented)
- Results: Unparalleled foundation quality and pattern complexity

## Educational Stratification

### Primary Education (Ages 5-16)
- Public Schools: Basic runic theory taught alongside standard subjects
- Trade Academies: Focus on practical mana manipulation for specific industries
- Noble Preparatory Schools: Advanced runic theory and foundation preparation
- Family Schools: Elite houses educate children privately with specialized tutors

### Specialization Period (Ages 18-21)
- Commoners: Apprenticeship in family trade or crystal farming
- Skilled Workers: Technical training in mana-based crafts and services
- Lower Nobility: Foundation establishment and basic core inscription
- High Nobility: Intensive foundation perfection before first circle attempt

### The Imperial Academy (Age 21+)
- Only those who have established at least their first circle can attend
- Entrance exams measure both runic knowledge and core quality
- Scholarship positions exist but are fiercely competitive
- Even among accepted students, resource allocation is strictly hierarchical

## Integration with Mana Beasts

### The Harvesting Cycle
- Cultivators hunt beasts → extract concentrated external mana → use for advancement → repeat
- Higher-class beasts provide superior external mana for more precise carving
- Natural runic formations in beast cores inspire new patterns for human cultivators
- Areas with dense ambient mana produce more powerful beasts, creating territorial competition

### Beast Core Quality
- Common beasts: Sufficient for first circle inscription
- Intermediate beasts: Required for second and third circle work
- Elite beasts: Necessary for fourth and fifth circle advancement
- Legendary beasts: Essential for highest circle achievements
- Ancient beasts: Rumored to contain mana qualities not found elsewhere

## Soul Binding Mechanics

### Technical Requirements
- The binding involves carving matching runic patterns across both cores simultaneously
- Requires perfect runic synchronization between participants
- Demands extraordinary external mana source (the dying Leviathan provides this)
- Creates permanent channels between their mana systems

### Historical Context
- Considered impossible in modern cultivation because:
  - It requires perfect runic synchronization
  - Modern cultivators lack knowledge of the ancient patterns
  - The external mana requirements are typically prohibitive
  - Most practitioners' runic systems would reject foreign patterns

### Effects on Cultivation
- Permanently links mana circulation, allowing shared resources
- Forces complete reconfiguration of planned runic structures
- Creates potential for hybrid techniques impossible for single cultivators
- May allow exceeding traditional nine-circle limit
