# Physical Transformation Through Cultivation

## Overview
One of the most visible effects of cultivation is the gradual transformation of the practitioner's physical appearance. As mana circulation refines the body and runic circles develop, cultivators undergo noticeable beautification that sets them apart from ordinary people. This transformation is both a mark of status and a potential source of alienation, creating complex social dynamics throughout imperial society.
