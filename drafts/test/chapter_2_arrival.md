# Chapter 2: Arrival

The *Wayfarer* settled onto the landing pad with barely a tremor, its systems compensating for atmospheric conditions with practiced efficiency. Michael waited in the ship's anteroom as the boarding ramp extended, watching through the small viewport as Academy officials arranged themselves in a reception line.

Six people. Less than the traditional welcome for a Great House heir, but more than he might have expected as the last Aurelius. Politics began before he even set foot on Academy grounds.

"Your belongings have been prepared for transfer, young master," Seraphina Everen said from behind him. Once the Hand of the Empress—her personal enforcer and bodyguard—Seraphina had been assigned to House Aurelius as an "advisor" three years ago. Michael had never been sure if she was meant to guard him or spy on his father. Perhaps both.

Now she was all that remained of his household staff besides the ship's crew.

"Thank you, Seraphina." He turned to face her. Unlike Michael in his formal house attire, Seraphina wore practical combat gear—muted colors with minimal ornamentation, designed for mobility and concealed protection. The only sign of her former status was a small imperial sun emblem on her collar, deliberately undersized.

"The Empress explicitly permitted you to retain your title and position," Seraphina said, studying his formal attire. "She did not, however, specify how prominently you should display them."

Michael raised an eyebrow. "Are you advising me to be less Aurelius?"

"I'm advising you to be strategically Aurelius," she replied, her expression neutral but her eyes sharp. "Your house has fallen. That creates both vulnerability and opportunity."

"Vulnerability I understand. What opportunity does extinction offer?"

"Freedom." She adjusted her stance slightly. "You are no longer bound by centuries of House Aurelius tradition and obligation. You alone decide what your house becomes now."

Michael considered her words. His father had rigidly maintained every Aurelius tradition, every protocol established over generations. He had been raised to do the same, to preserve rather than innovate.

Now preservation was impossible. House Aurelius would either transform or truly die with him.

"A valid perspective," he conceded. "But today, I represent what House Aurelius was. Tomorrow can wait."

Seraphina inclined her head, neither agreeing nor disagreeing. "As you wish, young master. Shall we?"

Michael nodded, and the outer door slid open with a soft hiss of equalizing pressure. The smell of the Capital—crisper, more processed than his homeworld's air—filled his lungs as he descended the ramp.

The Academy officials straightened as he approached, their expressions professionally neutral. At their center stood an older woman in formal administrative robes, her silver hair arranged in an elaborate style that marked her as a senior official.

"Lord Aurelius," she greeted him with a precise bow, exactly the depth required for addressing a Great House lord. "Welcome to the Imperial Academy. I am Administrator Eliza Vormir, Head of Student Affairs. On behalf of Headmistress Lyra Azemar, I extend the Academy's condolences for your loss and our pleasure at receiving you."

Michael returned the bow, matching her formality. "Administrator Vormir. House Aurelius thanks you for your welcome."

Her eyes flickered briefly to Seraphina before returning to Michael. "We've prepared accommodations according to your house's traditional preferences. Your registered companion may accompany you to the administrative complex for processing while our staff assists with your belongings."

"My advisor will remain with me," Michael said, noting the slight tightening around Vormir's eyes at his correction. "And my ship's crew will handle my belongings."

The administrator's smile remained fixed. "Of course, Lord Aurelius. As you prefer. If you'll follow me, we can complete your registration and orientation."

As they walked toward the imposing administrative building, Michael noted the other ships on the landing field. Most bore house insignias he recognized—Veracruz military precision, Thorne traditional elegance, Nevarrin industrial efficiency. The Laurent vessel gleamed unnaturally white against the others, its position central and prominent.

"The Princess has already arrived, I see," Michael observed casually.

Administrator Vormir nodded. "Indeed. Princess Victoria arrived yesterday with the other Laurent representatives. As First Princess, she naturally required additional security and protocol arrangements."

Michael noted the emphasis on Victoria's title. A reminder of her status, perhaps. Or a subtle indication of the distance between them now.

"Naturally," he agreed, keeping his tone neutral. "I look forward to seeing her again. We trained together as children."

"So I understand." The administrator's response was carefully measured. "Her Imperial Highness has a full schedule of specialized instruction in addition to her standard coursework. Her availability for social engagements is necessarily limited."

Message received. The childhood friendship between Michael Aurelius and Victoria Laurent was not being officially acknowledged or encouraged.

"I wouldn't dream of disrupting the Princess's schedule," Michael replied smoothly. "We all have our priorities at the Academy."

They approached the administrative complex, a sprawling structure of white stone and glass that managed to appear both ancient and modern simultaneously. Students in various house colors moved through the grounds, some alone, others in groups. Many paused to observe Michael's procession, their expressions ranging from curiosity to calculation.

"The registration process is typically straightforward for noble students," Administrator Vormir explained as they entered the building. "Though your... unique situation may require some additional documentation."

"My unique situation?" Michael kept his pace unhurried despite the administrator's attempt to quicken it.

"Your status as sole representative of your house," she clarified. "Certain administrative systems are designed with traditional house structures in mind. Adjustments may be necessary."

Before Michael could respond, a commotion in the main hall drew their attention. A group of students in rust-red uniforms with the Nevarrin mountain and pickaxe emblem had gathered near the central staircase. At their center stood a young man approximately Michael's age, his russet hair and amber crystalline eyes marking him clearly as Nevarrin mainline.

Julian Nevarrin. They had met at diplomatic functions years ago, neither making much impression on the other. House Nevarrin had been elevated to Great House status relatively recently, replacing another house that had fallen from Imperial favor.

A house that wasn't Aurelius.

Julian's gaze swept the hall and locked onto Michael. For a moment, surprise registered in his expression. Then his eyes narrowed, and he whispered something to the students surrounding him.

As one, the group turned to stare at Michael.

"Perhaps we should proceed to the private registration area," Administrator Vormir suggested, her voice lower. "Lord Nevarrin and his house members appear occupied with their own affairs."

"No need," Michael replied, deliberately changing course to walk directly toward the Nevarrin group. Behind him, he heard Seraphina's nearly silent sigh.

The Nevarrin students parted slightly as Michael approached, their expressions a mixture of surprise and wariness. Julian remained at their center, his stance shifting subtly into something more confrontational.

"Lord Nevarrin," Michael greeted him with a bow precisely one degree shallower than protocol demanded between Great House representatives. A minor slight, but one Julian would notice. "How fortunate to encounter you so quickly upon my arrival."

Julian's jaw tightened at the deliberate imprecision of the bow. "Lord Aurelius. We had heard rumors of your survival." His own bow came a calculated moment too late. "House Nevarrin extends its formal condolences for your... losses."

The pause before "losses" wasn't accidental. Neither was the plural form, encompassing not just Michael's family but his entire homeworld.

"Your concern is noted," Michael replied, the traditional response stripped of any warmth. "I look forward to observing how House Nevarrin adapts to its... elevated status." He allowed his gaze to drift over Julian's entourage. "The responsibilities of a Great House extend beyond mere title, after all."

Color rose in Julian's face. House Nevarrin's elevation remained controversial in some circles, with whispers that they had acquired their position through industrial leverage rather than merit or service.

"House Nevarrin understands its responsibilities quite well," Julian replied, his tone hardening. "We've spent the past six months strengthening our position while others were... absent from court."

A not-so-subtle reminder of Michael's extended journey back to the Capital, implying he had abandoned his duties during a critical period.

"Absence offers perspective, Lord Nevarrin." Michael maintained a pleasant expression despite the sharpening atmosphere. "I return with a clearer understanding of what truly matters in our Empire. I trust you'll discover the same, in time."

Before Julian could respond, Administrator Vormir stepped forward. "Lord Aurelius, your registration appointment is scheduled momentarily. Lord Nevarrin, I believe Combat Instructor Darius requested your presence for assessment at this hour."

The administrative intervention was transparent but effective. Julian held Michael's gaze for a moment longer before inclining his head slightly.

"Another time, Lord Aurelius. I'm certain we'll have ample opportunity to... compare perspectives during our training."

"I look forward to it," Michael replied with perfect courtesy, though both understood the underlying tension.

As Julian and his entourage departed, Michael turned back to Administrator Vormir, whose professionally neutral expression had acquired a hint of strain.

"Shall we continue to registration?" he suggested as if the interruption had been trivial.

"Yes, please follow me." She resumed their original course toward a side corridor. "The Academy encourages positive relationships between houses, Lord Aurelius. While historical rivalries are understood, we maintain strict protocols regarding confrontation outside of sanctioned activities."

"Of course," Michael agreed. "I wouldn't dream of disrupting Academy harmony."

Seraphina, walking slightly behind him, made a sound that might have been a suppressed snort.

As they proceeded deeper into the administrative complex, Michael noted the subtle but persistent stares from students and staff alike. His crimson Aurelius tunic stood out among the various house colors, a walking reminder of recent tragedy and uncertain politics.

Precisely as intended.

The Academy might prefer he arrive quietly, settle into obscurity, and allow the Empire to forget the uncomfortable questions raised by his house's destruction. The Empress might desire the same, judging by her delayed summons.

But Michael Aurelius had not traveled six months through space, the last survivor of a murdered world, to fade into convenient anonymity.

He had come to find answers.

And if those answers disrupted Imperial harmony, so be it.
