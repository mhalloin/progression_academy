# Chapter 4: Assessment

Michael stood at the edge of the combat assessment arena, observing the other noble first-years as they prepared for evaluation. The space was impressive—a circular field nearly fifty meters in diameter, surrounded by reinforced observation platforms. Runic arrays covered both floor and walls, designed to contain energy discharges while measuring power output with precision.

Administrator Vormir had explained the process during his registration. Combat assessment would establish baseline capabilities, determine appropriate training regimens, and—most importantly—assign students to ranked classes. The advanced combat class, comprising the top twenty students, received specialized instruction and access to restricted facilities. For noble houses, placing heirs in this elite group was a matter of both pride and practical advantage.

"They've divided us into four groups," Seraphina observed quietly beside him. Though officially present as his advisor, she had quickly assumed a more practical role—identifying political currents Michael might miss after six months isolated in space. "Princess Laurent is in the first group with four other students. You're in the last."

"Maximum separation," Michael noted. "Predictable."

Seraphina's gaze swept the arena's upper levels, where senior Academy staff had gathered to observe. "The Empress's influence extends deep into Academy administration."

"And yet they still classified me as a Great House representative." Michael adjusted the fit of his house tunic, the crimson fabric standing out among the more subdued Academy uniforms most students had chosen to wear. "Interesting contradiction."

"Politics rarely follows straight lines, young master," Seraphina replied. "Sometimes maintaining protocol in one area makes deviation in another more acceptable."

Before Michael could respond, a sharp tone signaled the beginning of the assessment. The first group of students moved toward the center of the arena, Victoria's white-clad figure instantly recognizable among them. Despite official separation from the other students, she moved with easy confidence, her posture perfect but not rigid, her golden-blonde hair gleaming under the arena lights.

"First group, please take your positions," announced a tall woman in combat instructor's uniform. "I am Professor Seraphina Rayne, Advanced Combat Division. Today's assessment will evaluate four key metrics: power capacity, technique execution, adaptive response, and combat efficiency."

Michael noted the flash of recognition in Victoria's eyes at the instructor's name. Seraphina Rayne had a formidable reputation—a former Imperial Champion who had retired to teaching after a legendary career. Her presence for first-year assessment indicated the Academy's interest in this particular class.

"Each student will perform three demonstrations," Professor Rayne continued. "First, a standard capacity test. Second, execution of three techniques of your choice. Third, a simulated combat scenario against a runic construct. Your performance will be scored on both absolute capability and relative efficiency."

The five students moved to designated positions at equal distances around the arena's center, where a complex runic array began to glow with building energy.

"Princess Laurent, you will begin," Professor Rayne announced.

Victoria stepped forward with measured grace, her movement so precise it seemed choreographed. She drew her rapier in a single fluid motion, the impossibly thin blade catching light along its edge.

"Standard capacity demonstration, Princess," the professor instructed. "Full power, contained projection."

Victoria nodded once, then assumed a standard imperial stance—feet precisely shoulder-width apart, blade held at exact center-line, left hand positioned with calculated balance. For three heartbeats, she remained perfectly still, gathering her energy.

Then light exploded from her body.

Golden-white radiance poured from Victoria's form, so brilliant that many observers raised hands to shield their eyes. The light coalesced around her rapier, flowing into the weapon until the blade seemed to extend three meters beyond its physical length, a pure beam of concentrated energy.

The measuring runes in the arena floor pulsed in response, recording the power output. Above the arena, a numerical display flickered rapidly before stabilizing: 8,246.

A murmur swept through the watching students. For a first-year to register above 8,000 units was extraordinary—most noble students entered the Academy with capacities between 4,000 and 5,000 units. Even the advanced combat class typically ranged from 5,000 to 6,000 units.

Victoria maintained the projection for the required ten seconds, her control absolute. Not a flicker of variation, not a hint of strain. When she released the technique, the light receded in a controlled fade rather than the sharp cutoff most students would demonstrate.

Professor Rayne's expression remained neutral, but her nod conveyed professional approval. "Technique demonstrations, Princess."

Victoria moved into her first technique without hesitation—a classic Laurent light-step that carried her across the arena in a blur of motion, leaving afterimages of luminescence in her wake. The execution was flawless, the energy expenditure precisely calibrated.

Her second technique demonstrated the defensive capabilities of imperial light manipulation—a shield of interlocking geometric patterns that refracted and amplified incoming energy. When the assessment system launched a standardized attack against it, the shield not only absorbed the impact but redirected it into a controlled spiral of light that dissipated harmlessly.

For her final technique, Victoria chose something less traditional. Rather than a pure Laurent method, she executed a hybrid form—light projection channeled through what appeared to be a spatial compression matrix. The resulting technique created multiple light-points that converged from different angles, striking a target dummy simultaneously from six directions.

Michael recognized elements of Aurelius spatial theory in the approach. Techniques they had explored together years ago, now refined and integrated into her combat style.

The observation platforms fell silent as Victoria completed her demonstration. Even Professor Rayne seemed momentarily at a loss for words before recovering her professional demeanor.

"Impressive innovation, Princess. Finally, the combat simulation."

A runic construct materialized in the center of the arena—a humanoid form composed of pure energy, wielding a similar energy weapon. The construct bowed formally to Victoria, then assumed a combat stance.

"Standard simulation, difficulty calibrated to your demonstrated capacity," Professor Rayne explained. "The objective is efficient neutralization, not maximum display. Begin when ready."

Victoria saluted the construct with her rapier, then moved into engagement range with deliberate grace. The construct attacked immediately, its energy blade sweeping in a textbook strike that Victoria parried with minimal motion. Her counter was equally precise—not overwhelming force, but perfect placement that exploited the construct's programmed recovery pattern.

The exchange continued for nearly a minute, Victoria's movements becoming increasingly efficient as she adapted to the construct's patterns. She never used more energy than necessary, never moved further than required, every action calculated for maximum effect with minimum expenditure.

When she finally neutralized the construct with a precisely targeted thrust to its core matrix, the efficiency rating flashed above: 94%.

Another murmur swept the observation platforms. Even among advanced students, efficiency ratings above 80% were considered exceptional.

Victoria sheathed her rapier and bowed to Professor Rayne, then walked calmly back to the waiting area, her expression revealing nothing of her thoughts.

The remaining students in the first group performed their assessments with varying degrees of competence. A Thorne heir demonstrated impressive elemental communion techniques but struggled with efficiency. A Veracruz representative showed excellent tactical adaptation but lower raw power. None approached Victoria's combination of capacity, technical precision, and efficiency.

As the second group began their assessment, Michael found his attention divided between the performances and the reactions of watching students. Most displayed expected responses—admiration, envy, calculation. But one figure on the opposite observation platform caught his interest—a young woman with midnight blue hair who seemed more interested in the runic arrays than the combat displays.

Something about her focused attention, the way she tracked specific energy patterns rather than overall performance, suggested specialized knowledge. When Victoria had performed her hybrid technique, the woman's expression had shifted from academic interest to intense focus.

Michael made a mental note to identify her later. Anyone with that level of technical interest in runic theory might prove valuable.

The second and third groups completed their assessments without notable deviation from expectations. Julian Nevarrin demonstrated impressive raw power—7,824 units—and efficient Nevarrin combat techniques focused on overwhelming force. His efficiency rating of 82% placed him firmly in the top echelon, though still below Victoria's performance.

When the fourth group was called forward, Michael moved to his designated position with measured steps. He noted Julian Nevarrin's continued presence on the observation platform despite having completed his own assessment—clearly interested in evaluating the last Aurelius's capabilities.

"Lord Aurelius," Professor Rayne nodded in acknowledgment. "Standard capacity demonstration, please."

Michael drew his slender longsword, the blade almost plain-looking compared to some of the more ornate weapons displayed by other noble students. Only close examination would reveal the thousands of microscopic runes etched into its surface—Aurelius spatial manipulation formulas refined over generations.

He assumed the standard Aurelius stance—balanced but fluid, designed for sudden spatial transitions. Unlike Victoria's light projection, which manifested as visible brilliance, spatial manipulation created more subtle effects. As Michael channeled power through his core, the air around him seemed to warp slightly, light bending as space itself compressed and expanded in controlled patterns.

His sword became the focus point, reality distorting around its edge until the blade seemed to exist in multiple places simultaneously—not afterimages, but actual instances of the same object occupying adjacent spatial coordinates.

The measurement runes pulsed, struggling momentarily to calculate energy that existed partially outside normal spatial parameters. Finally, the display stabilized: 8,172.

Another murmur from the observers. Two first-years above 8,000 units, when one would be remarkable. Michael maintained the demonstration for the required period, then released the technique with careful control, allowing space to normalize gradually rather than snap back.

"Technique demonstrations," Professor Rayne instructed, her professional neutrality intact despite the unusual display.

Michael moved into his first technique without hesitation—a spatial leap that transported him instantaneously from one position to another without passing through the intervening space. Unlike Victoria's light-step, which created a blur of motion, Michael simply disappeared and reappeared, the transition instantaneous and nearly silent.

For his second demonstration, he executed a defensive technique—not a shield, but a spatial distortion that redirected incoming attacks through warped dimensions. When the assessment system launched its standardized attack, the energy seemed to curve around Michael before emerging behind him, its trajectory altered without any visible barrier.

His final technique was something more complex—a multi-layered spatial manipulation that created a cascade of fold points around a target dummy. As the technique activated, the dummy appeared to implode as space contracted around it from multiple directions simultaneously, crushing it into a fraction of its original size.

The observing students fell silent again, many clearly struggling to understand what they had just witnessed. Spatial manipulation was rare enough; this level of control in a first-year student was unprecedented.

"The combat simulation, Lord Aurelius," Professor Rayne said after a moment.

A new runic construct formed in the arena center, identical to the one Victoria had faced. It bowed formally, then assumed a combat stance.

Michael returned the bow with precise courtesy, then engaged, his approach distinctly different from Victoria's measured grace. Where she had been efficient and precise, Michael's style emphasized unpredictability. He combined conventional bladework with moments of spatial distortion, appearing to step between positions rather than moving through them.

The construct's programming struggled to adapt to his rhythm, its attacks increasingly off-target as it failed to predict his spatial transitions. Michael never used brute force, relying instead on positioning and timing. His blade would appear precisely where the construct's defenses were weakest, exploiting openings created by its own momentum.

When he finally neutralized the construct with a strike that seemed to come from three directions simultaneously, the efficiency rating appeared: 93%.

One percentage point below Victoria's performance. Michael suspected the rating system valued consistency over unpredictability, a reasonable bias for academic evaluation. In actual combat, unpredictability often compensated for minor inefficiencies.

He sheathed his sword and bowed to Professor Rayne, whose expression remained carefully neutral despite the exceptional demonstration.

"Thank you, Lord Aurelius," she said, then turned to address all assembled students. "Assessment results will be processed and class assignments posted by this evening. You are dismissed for your midday meal. Afternoon orientation begins at third bell."

As students began to disperse, Michael noted the various reactions to his performance. Julian Nevarrin's expression had hardened into barely concealed hostility. Several other noble students displayed a mixture of surprise and calculation, reassessing the political landscape. And the blue-haired woman from the observation platform was now watching him with undisguised interest, her gaze analytical rather than social.

"Impressive control, young master," Seraphina commented as he rejoined her at the edge of the arena. "Though perhaps more revealing than strictly necessary."

"There's value in being underestimated," Michael replied, "but not at the cost of being dismissed. Better they know now what House Aurelius represents."

"They certainly know that an Aurelius and a Laurent once again stand at the top of their class," Seraphina observed dryly. "I imagine that information is already traveling to the Imperial Palace."

Michael glanced across the dispersing crowd, catching a glimpse of Victoria as she departed with her imperial guards. For a moment, just before she passed through the exit, she glanced back. Their eyes met briefly across the distance, a moment of acknowledgment that required no words.

Then she was gone, resuming her carefully scheduled imperial existence while Michael turned toward his own uncertain path through the Academy hierarchy.

"Time for the midday meal," he said to Seraphina. "I believe the central dining hall will be... informative."

"More politics, young master?" Seraphina sighed with resignation.

"Always," Michael replied, his expression neutral but his eyes alert. "The combat assessment was merely the opening move. The real game begins now."
