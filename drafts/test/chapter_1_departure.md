# Chapter 1: Departure

Michael Aurelius stood at the viewport of his personal ship, the *Wayfarer*, watching the stars blur as they prepared for the final jump to the Imperial Capital. He absently traced a finger along the window's edge, activating the microscopic runes etched into the transparent material. A subtle ripple of spatial energy spread from his touch, enhancing the structural integrity of the already formidable barrier.

Old habits. Always reinforcing, always securing.

"Young master," a voice called from behind him. "Final preparations for the jump are complete."

Michael turned to face Reylan Vex, the aging captain who had served House Aurelius for longer than Michael had been alive. The grizzled veteran's face remained carefully neutral, but Michael caught the concern in his eyes.

"Thank you, Reylan." Michael's gaze drifted back to the stars. "How long since we last visited the capital?"

"Three years, four months, and seventeen days, young master." Reylan's precise answer held unspoken weight. They both knew it had been the last time Michael and his father had gone together.

Before everything had changed.

Michael nodded, smoothing nonexistent wrinkles from his crimson tunic. The deep Aurelius red stood in stark contrast to the ship's sleek, monochromatic interior. For generations, his family had controlled the empire's teleportation network, making this conventional travel almost nostalgic. But teleportation stations required maintenance from both sides. And the Aurelius station on his homeworld no longer existed.

Neither did the homeworld itself.

"Initiate the jump, Captain," Michael said. "I should prepare for arrival."

"Yes, young master." Reylan hesitated, then added, "Your father would be proud."

Michael forced his expression to remain neutral as he turned away. Six months had passed since the destruction. Six months of travel through conventional space, making his way back to the heart of the empire. Six months to process what he had witnessed.

Six months was not enough.

In his quarters, Michael sat cross-legged on the floor, palms resting on his knees. The room was sparsely decorated—a bed, a desk with several ancient texts, and a weapons rack holding his slender longsword. The sword's handle gleamed with faint runic patterns that matched those inscribed along its blade, thousands of microscopic sigils visible only to trained eyes.

His father's final gift.

Michael closed his eyes and drew breath slowly, focusing on his core. Within his chest, a dense sphere of mana pulsed with crimson energy. Most cultivators at his level—the Second Circle—maintained cores roughly the size of a clenched fist. Michael's was nearly twice that size, the result of specialized enhancement techniques developed over generations by House Aurelius.

As he cycled his mana, he felt the familiar resistance. Enhanced cores required more resources to advance, a trade-off his family had always deemed worthwhile. Quality over quantity. Depth over speed.

Michael had completed his Second Circle three years ago at age eighteen, a remarkable achievement even among noble houses. By now, he should have been well into his Third Circle, possibly approaching his Fourth. Instead, he had stagnated, focusing all his energy on strengthening his foundation rather than advancement.

Another lesson from his father. "When facing uncertainty, reinforce what you have rather than reaching for what you don't."

He pushed his awareness deeper, examining the intricate runic patterns inscribed within his core. Most were traditional Imperial designs—efficiency, resilience, control. But nestled among them were unique configurations developed by House Aurelius, focused on spatial manipulation and teleportation affinity.

Michael extended his hand, palm up. Space rippled above it, condensing into a small sphere of distorted reality. He manipulated the sphere, stretching it, compressing it, folding it in on itself. The exercise demanded precision rather than power, control rather than raw strength.

A soft chime interrupted his concentration. The sphere dissolved as Michael opened his eyes.

"Young master," Reylan's voice came through the communication system. "We're approaching the Imperial Capital. Estimated arrival in twenty minutes."

"Thank you, Reylan." Michael rose smoothly to his feet. "Has the Academy acknowledged our arrival request?"

"Yes, young master. You've been cleared for immediate registration upon landing. The Empress has also... requested your presence at the palace tomorrow morning."

Michael noted the hesitation. "Not tonight?"

"No, young master. The message indicated tomorrow would be sufficient."

That was unexpected. As the sole survivor of a Great House, Michael had anticipated an immediate summons. The delay suggested something more calculated. Politics, most likely. The Empress allowing him a night to settle in before whatever was coming.

"Understood. Please have my formal attire prepared for tomorrow." He moved to the weapons rack and lifted his sword, checking the edge more from habit than necessity. The blade never dulled, another benefit of its runic enhancements.

"Will you be wearing house colors for registration, young master?"

Michael paused, considering. House Aurelius still existed—in him alone. The proud crimson that had once represented one of the empire's most powerful families now marked him as the last of his line. Wearing it would make a statement, one that would draw attention from the moment he stepped off the ship.

"Yes," he decided. "Full house colors and insignia."

If they expected him to arrive diminished, to hide his heritage or downplay his status, they would be disappointed. He might be the last Aurelius, but he was still an Aurelius.

And it was time the Imperial Capital remembered what that meant.

The Capital planet hung in space like a jewel, its night side glittering with countless lights while the day side showed carefully managed continents and impossibly blue oceans. Orbital stations and defense platforms formed concentric rings around the planet, while ships of various sizes moved in precise, regulated patterns.

Michael stood on the bridge of the *Wayfarer* as they descended through the atmosphere, following their assigned trajectory. Below, the Imperial City spread across the horizon, a vast metropolis of gleaming spires and ancient monuments. At its center rose the Imperial Palace, a structure so massive it was visible even from their altitude.

And to the east, separated from the main city by sculpted parkland, stood the Imperial Academy of Cultivation. Even from this distance, Michael could see the enormous mana well at its center, a pillar of shimmering energy rising into the sky.

"Impressive, isn't it?" Reylan said, joining him at the viewport. "The capital has grown since your last visit."

"So it has." Michael studied the sprawling Academy complex. For the next five years, it would be his home. Under normal circumstances, he would have begun his training there at age eighteen, alongside other heirs from noble houses. His father's insistence on specialized training had delayed his enrollment—a decision that had inadvertently saved his life.

Now, at twenty-one, he would be entering with students his own age but with vastly different experiences. While they had been attending preliminary academies or receiving house training, he had been surviving the destruction of his entire world.

The ship descended toward the Academy's private landing area, reserved for noble houses and official visitors. As they approached, Michael noted several other ships already docked—sleek vessels bearing the colors and insignias of Great Houses. Thorne. Veracruz. Nevarrin. Azemar.

And at the center of the landing area, a gleaming white ship emblazoned with the sun symbol of House Laurent—the Imperial Family.

Michael's eyes narrowed slightly. Victoria Laurent. They had been childhood friends, bound by diplomatic relations between their houses and their shared status as exceptional cultivators. They had trained together during Victoria's visits to the Aurelius homeworld, developing a friendship that transcended political alliances.

At least, that's what he had believed.

In the six months since the destruction, he had received no communication from her. Not a message, not an inquiry about his survival, nothing. Only official notifications regarding his Academy enrollment, signed by administrative staff rather than Victoria herself.

"Sir," one of the bridge officers called. "We're receiving a priority message from Academy Administration. They're asking about the duration of your stay."

Michael pulled his attention back to the present. "Tell them this ship will remain docked for the duration of my enrollment. The crew will maintain minimal operations and be available as needed."

The officer hesitated. "Sir, the standard protocol for noble students is to send family ships back after unloading equipment and belongings. Long-term docking requires special authorization and significant fees."

"House Aurelius has maintained a permanent docking bay at the Academy for over three hundred years," Michael replied evenly. "Check the registry. Bay 17-A, East Quadrant. Our authorization is perpetual, established by Imperial Charter during the reign of Emperor Caius IV."

The officer flushed slightly. "I'll inform them immediately, sir."

Michael turned back to the viewport as they made their final approach. Below, he could see figures gathering near the landing pad—Academy staff preparing for his arrival, no doubt. Standard protocol for a Great House heir.

Except he wasn't just an heir anymore. He was the last of his line, arriving to take his place in an Academy that had educated Aurelius cultivators for generations.

"We've been cleared for landing, young master," Reylan reported. "Academy Administration has verified your docking rights."

"Thank you, Reylan." Michael straightened his crimson tunic, with the geometric gate symbol of House Aurelius prominently displayed over his heart. "Prepare for landing."

Time to see if the Imperial Capital remembered how to receive an Aurelius.
