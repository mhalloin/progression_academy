# Chapter 20: Preparations

Five months at the Imperial Academy had changed Michael Aurelius in subtle but significant ways. His posture remained precise, his movements calculated, but a new fluidity had replaced the rigid control he'd maintained upon arrival. His crimson Aurelius uniform, once a deliberate statement of defiance, now seemed simply a natural extension of his identity—worn with quiet confidence rather than pointed declaration.

As he performed final equipment checks in the Academy's preparation hall, Michael could sense the different energy surrounding this third expedition. The first hunt with assigned teams had been a controlled introduction; the second, with the military operation, a deliberate test of adaptability. This specialized Advanced Combat Class hunt represented something else entirely—genuine opportunity for significant advancement.

"Core extraction tools calibrated and secured," Kaelen reported, completing his own equipment verification. Over the past months, the frontier student had evolved from cautious ally to trusted team member, his practical experience complementing Michael's theoretical training. "Environmental sensors are showing green across all parameters."

"Communication arrays synchronized," Nolan added, his weathered features focused on the compact runic device he was adjusting. "Primary, secondary, and emergency channels all functional." The veteran frontier defender had proven invaluable for security protocols and tactical planning, his real-world experience balancing the Academy's often theoretical approaches.

Michael nodded acknowledgment, continuing his methodical inventory. Around them, other Advanced Combat Class students performed similar preparations, though with varying approaches. Julian Nevarrin's team emphasized overwhelming force, their equipment geared toward maximum damage output. House Thorne representatives focused on traditional methodology, their preparation ritualized and formal. House Veracruz students operated with military precision, their movements efficient and coordinated.

And Victoria Laurent worked with her assigned imperial guards, her preparation simultaneously meticulous and graceful. Though officially she maintained appropriate distance, Michael had noticed gradual shifts in her interaction patterns over the past months—small adjustments that created occasional opportunities for genuine exchange beneath the formal protocols.

"Lord Aurelius," a voice interrupted his thoughts. "A moment of your time?"

Michael turned to find Professor Rayne standing nearby, her expression professionally neutral but her eyes conveying specific interest.

"Of course, Professor," he replied, stepping aside for private conversation.

Professor Rayne had proven an interesting study over the past months. As lead instructor for the Advanced Combat Class, she maintained rigorous standards while demonstrating surprising adaptability in teaching methodology. Her background as a former Imperial Champion gave her perspectives that transcended typical Academy limitations, though she carefully modulated how much of that experience she shared with students.

"Your team's performance in simulation exercises has been noteworthy," she began without preamble. "Particularly your integration of Mr. Voss and Mr. Carter's frontier methodologies with traditional house techniques."

"Diverse approaches provide tactical advantages," Michael replied. "House Aurelius has always valued effective innovation."

Professor Rayne nodded slightly. "Indeed. However, this expedition involves variables beyond standard training parameters. The hunting grounds you'll be accessing contain higher-level threat potentials than previous expeditions."

"The briefing mentioned B-rank beasts with occasional A-rank territorial dominants," Michael noted. "Well within Advanced Class capability ranges."

"Within capability, yes," Professor Rayne agreed. "Though requiring appropriate coordination and situational awareness." She paused briefly. "The northern quadrant contains particularly valuable resources, but environmental conditions create communication difficulties. Teams operating in that sector should maintain visual contact protocols."

The statement contained more specific direction than professors typically provided before student expeditions. Michael recognized it as deliberate information sharing rather than standard briefing supplement.

"I appreciate the tactical insight, Professor," he acknowledged. "We'll adjust our operational parameters accordingly."

"See that you do." She glanced briefly toward where Victoria was preparing with her imperial guards. "All students should return safely from educational expeditions, regardless of their statistical capability assessments."

Before Michael could respond to the loaded statement, Professor Rayne moved away, continuing her rounds among the preparing students. Her warning—for that was clearly what it had been—added unexpected context to the expedition parameters.

Michael returned to his team, considering implications. "Adjust communication protocols for potential disruption," he instructed quietly. "And add emergency contingencies for the northern quadrant."

Kaelen and Nolan exchanged glances before nodding. Neither asked for explanation, having learned over months of collaboration to trust Michael's strategic adjustments.

"I'll modify the extraction kit for rapid deployment," Kaelen said, reopening his equipment case. "Frontier emergency configuration rather than standard Academy protocol."

"And I'll recalibrate the perimeter sensors for heightened alert thresholds," Nolan added. "Better false positives than missed threats."

As they implemented these changes, Michael maintained awareness of the broader preparation hall dynamics. Julian Nevarrin's team had positioned themselves conspicuously in the central area, their conversation just loud enough to carry to nearby teams—deliberate intimidation through projected confidence. Several other noble-affiliated students maintained proximity to Julian's group, while others created careful distance that wouldn't register as deliberate avoidance.

Michael's own team occupied a position near the eastern preparation stations—not isolated, but separated enough for practical privacy. The past months had established their reputation for unorthodox but effective methodology, creating a buffer of professional respect if not social integration.

"Final equipment checks complete, young master," Seraphina reported, joining them after her own preparations. Though officially still his advisor, she had gradually shifted into a more practical role as combat specialist and security coordinator.

"Thank you, Seraphina," Michael replied. "Professor Rayne provided some interesting insights about the northern quadrant. We've adjusted accordingly."

Seraphina's expression remained neutral, but her eyes conveyed understanding of the subtext. "A thoughtful professor. Her experience extends beyond academic qualification."

Further conversation was interrupted by the appearance of the expedition coordinator—a senior Academy administrator responsible for formal mission parameters and team assignments.

"Advanced Combat Class," the coordinator announced, his voice amplified through the hall. "Final preparation period concludes in fifteen minutes. All teams report to transport staging for deployment sequence and hunting ground assignments."

The announcement accelerated activity throughout the hall, students completing final checks with increased urgency. Michael's team, having finished their adjustments, began securing equipment for transport.

"Primary objective remains core acquisition with optimal quality preservation," Michael reminded them. "Secondary objective is environmental assessment for unusual energy patterns or spatial anomalies."

This second objective remained private to their team—part of their ongoing investigation into dimensional phenomena potentially connected to the Aurelius system's destruction. Lyra Starmind had provided specialized detection equipment disguised as standard Academy research tools, allowing them to conduct parallel exploration without obvious deviation from mission parameters.

"Understood," Kaelen confirmed. "Quality over quantity, with priority on unusual energy signatures."

"And continuous spatial mapping throughout," Nolan added, securing a device that appeared standard but contained Lyra's modified detection arrays.

As they finished preparations, Michael noticed Victoria concluding her own equipment checks. Her movements maintained perfect imperial grace even in practical tasks, each action precise without appearing mechanical. When she glanced in his direction, he gave an almost imperceptible nod—acknowledgment without obvious interaction. Her equally subtle response confirmed shared awareness while maintaining appropriate separation.

Five months of careful navigation had created understanding beyond words, despite institutional barriers and political constraints. Whether that understanding would prove valuable during actual field operations remained to be seen.

"Advanced Combat Class, proceed to transport staging," the coordinator announced. "Team assignments will be confirmed at deployment."

Students moved toward the exit in ordered groups, house affiliations creating natural clustering despite the expedition's official team structures. Michael's team maintained their independent positioning, neither aligning with nor deliberately avoiding other factions.

The transport staging area occupied a large platform at the Academy's eastern edge, where specialized vessels waited to carry students to designated hunting grounds. Unlike standard educational expeditions, which utilized conventional bulk transport, the Advanced Combat Class rated individual team vessels—smaller, faster craft that offered greater deployment flexibility.

"Team Aurelius, Vessel Seven," the assignment officer directed as they reached the staging area. "Northern quadrant, Sector Three."

Michael noted the specific assignment with interest. Professor Rayne's warning had highlighted the northern quadrant's unique characteristics; being specifically assigned there suggested either random distribution or deliberate placement. Given the Academy's careful management of educational experiences, true randomness seemed unlikely.

Their assigned vessel was a sleek craft designed for rapid deployment and efficient resource transport—modern but not exceptional. As they boarded and secured their equipment, Michael observed other teams receiving their assignments. Julian Nevarrin's group was directed to the eastern quadrant, traditionally considered prime hunting territory for conventional core harvesting.

Most interesting, however, was Victoria's assignment. Rather than being grouped with her usual imperial guards in a protected central sector, she was being directed to the northern quadrant, Sector Four—adjacent to Michael's team's assignment.

Either coincidence, administrative error, or deliberate positioning. Given imperial protocols regarding the Princess's security, the first two possibilities seemed highly improbable.

Michael stored this observation as they completed boarding procedures and prepared for departure. Whatever forces had influenced assignment distribution, the practical reality remained unchanged: they would be operating in a challenging environment with significant opportunity for both advancement and risk.

"All vessels, prepare for launch sequence," came the coordinator's final announcement. "Expedition duration is set for five days standard. Emergency recall protocols have been synchronized to all communication arrays. Advanced Combat Class, you are cleared for deployment."

As their vessel lifted smoothly from the platform, Michael moved to the observation viewport, watching the Academy recede below them. Five months of preparation, training, and careful alliance building had brought them to this point—their first real opportunity for significant field operation with meaningful advancement potential.

And perhaps, more importantly, an opportunity to gather information beyond the Academy's controlled environment. If dimensional anomalies existed in the northern quadrant, as Professor Rayne's warning might imply, they could provide valuable data for the investigation Lyra was quietly conducting.

The vessel accelerated into upper atmosphere, joining the formation of Advanced Class transports as they set course for the designated hunting grounds. Within the cabin, Michael's team performed final equipment adjustments and mental preparation, each following methodologies that balanced their individual backgrounds with collective coordination.

"ETA to deployment zone approximately four hours," the pilot announced through the internal communication system. "Preliminary environmental scans indicate optimal hunting conditions with moderate atmospheric interference. Please secure all equipment for potential turbulence during descent phase."

Michael acknowledged the information while continuing his own preparation—a specialized meditation technique that enhanced spatial awareness while conserving core energy. The coming expedition would test not just their combat capabilities but their investigative methodology as well.

Whatever awaited them in the northern quadrant—standard hunting opportunities or something more significant—his team would approach it with balanced preparation and adaptive response. House Aurelius had always emphasized comprehensive readiness rather than narrow specialization.

And perhaps, if circumstances aligned, opportunities beyond mere core harvesting might present themselves. Victoria's unexpected proximity in the assignment distribution created potential for interaction outside the Academy's carefully managed environment—interaction that might advance understanding beyond what institutional constraints permitted.

Michael completed his meditation cycle and rejoined his team for final coordination. The vessel continued its smooth trajectory toward the hunting grounds, carrying them toward whatever the northern quadrant might reveal.

Advanced Combat Class third expedition: officially beginning.
