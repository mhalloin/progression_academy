# First Year Hunting Progression

## Month 1: Academy Introduction (Classes Only)

The first month at the Imperial Academy establishes baseline knowledge, student social hierarchies, and introduces the academy's reputation system and badge identification. For Michael and Victoria, this month involves:

### Power Assessment and Social Positioning
- Initial combat and power assessments place Michael and Victoria at exceptional levels (~8,000 units)
- Julian Nevarrin emerges as primary antagonist for Michael in the Advanced Combat Class
- House-based factions begin to form, leaving Michael isolated without natural allies
- Victoria maintains proper imperial distance despite shared history with Michael
- Badge system makes student rank and house affiliations immediately visible

### Class Structure and Academic Focus
- Foundational cultivation theory with emphasis on controlled core expansion
- Basic extraction techniques for mana beast cores
- Introduction to the academy reputation system and ranking structure
- Combat classes establish skill baselines and identify exceptional students
- Faculty notes Michael and Victoria's unusual core development patterns

### Initial Social Challenges
- Michael experiences isolation as the last representative of a fallen great house
- Noble students avoid association to prevent political complications
- Victoria navigates her role as both imperial representative and first-year student
- Julian consolidates support among Nevarrin vassals and sympathetic houses
- Political undercurrents influence all interactions despite academic setting

## Month 2: First Year Hunt with Assigned Teams

The academy's first expedition follows strict protocols designed to evaluate students in controlled field conditions while providing foundational experience.

### Team Assignment Process
- Academy administrators deliberately assign five-person balanced teams
- Michael and Victoria placed on separate teams for "objective evaluation"
- Victoria assigned to team with other high noble students (Laurent vassals and allies)
- Her imperial guards shadow her team, maintaining protective distance
- Michael assigned to team with minor noble students wary of Aurelius association

### Expedition Structure
- Large-scale expedition involving all first-year students
- Heavily regulated hunting grounds with primarily D-rank beasts
- Significant faculty supervision and strict safety protocols
- Limited core harvesting opportunities due to student-to-beast ratio
- Controlled environment designed for skill assessment rather than resource acquisition

### Team Dynamics
- Victoria's team functions efficiently with natural deference to her status
- Her guards maintain protective distance without interfering with hunting
- Michael's assigned teammates maintain cold distance despite his attempts at collaboration
- Team members exclude him from strategy discussions and coordination
- Despite isolation, Michael demonstrates exceptional combat effectiveness
- Individual success in isolation rather than team integration

### Post-Hunt Assessment
- Teams return with modest core harvests appropriate for first expedition
- Michael's team claims disproportionate shares citing "greater team contribution"
- Michael allows the inequity rather than creating conflict but notes the injustice
- Returns with determination to form his own team for future expeditions
- Begins identifying potential allies who seem less prejudiced against his house
- Faculty evaluation notes highlight individual performance over team cohesion

## Month 3: Team Formation Obstacles (Classes Only)

Following the first expedition, students process their harvested cores and prepare for future hunts while academic focus shifts to more advanced techniques.

### Administrative Restrictions
- Michael attempts to register for private hunting using his own ship and crew
- Administration rejects request, citing academy regulations requiring student teams
- Discovers Victoria has been granted special dispensation for private hunt with imperial guards
- Frustration builds as his modern Aurelius ship and experienced crew remain docked
- Experiences bureaucratic barriers that even Aurelius wealth cannot overcome

### Core Processing Focus
- Specialized classes on optimal core extraction and processing techniques
- Students face critical choice between processing cores for personal advancement or exchanging for resources
- Michael processes all cores personally while observing others forced to exchange theirs
- Growing awareness of economic advantages in cultivation progression
- Victoria also focuses on personal advancement with imperial resources

### Recruitment Efforts
- Michael actively seeks team members from non-aligned students
- Faces rejection from many due to fear of political repercussions
- Identifies Kaelen and Nolan (common-born exceptional students) as potential allies
- First connections with students who judge on merit rather than house politics
- Plans to qualify for military joint operation as alternative to standard hunting

### Tournament or Contest
- Mid-term contest highlights combat abilities in controlled setting
- Michael performs exceptionally despite lack of team support
- Victoria balances imperial dignity with competitive performance
- Julian displays aggression and intimidation tactics
- Faculty identifies advanced combat class as exceptionally talented cohort

## Month 4: Military Joint Operation vs. Private House Hunts

The second expedition creates stark divisions as great houses sponsor private hunts for affiliated students, leaving Michael as the only advanced combat class student without house-backed expedition access.

### Widening Opportunity Gap
- All great houses organize private hunts for their affiliated students
- Victoria departs with only imperial guards for exclusive Laurent hunting grounds
- Julian and other Nevarrin-affiliated students access premium territories with house resources
- Other advanced combat class students participate in respective house expeditions
- Common-born standouts like Kaelen and Nolan secured sponsorship from minor houses
- Michael discovers he is the only advanced combat class student without private hunt access

### Michael's Military Hunt
- Qualifies for military joint operation through exceptional power level
- Only first-year student to meet the 10,000+ units threshold for participation
- Also only advanced combat class student relegated to non-private expedition
- Assigned to team with older common-born students from lower-ranked houses
- Older teammates view him as privileged noble outsider despite his outcast status
- Noble students with weak house connections participate but distance themselves from Michael
- Caught between worlds - too noble for common-born students, too tainted for noble ones

### Core Distribution Conflict
- At expedition end, team refuses to share cores with Michael
- "You can buy whatever cores you need with your Aurelius fortune"
- Michael attempts to buy goodwill by agreeing, surprising the team
- Temporary resolution without addressing fundamental social divide
- First genuine understanding of systemic barriers facing common-born students

### Contrasting Returns
- Victoria and other house-affiliated students return with premium core harvests
- Michael returns with meager personal share after team conflict
- Advancement gap between house-backed students and others becomes starkly apparent
- First clear evidence of sponsorship's critical importance despite personal abilities
- Frustration about his unused ship and crew intensifies as he falls further behind
- Recognition that his technological resources are useless without social connections

## Month 5: Faction Formation (Classes Only)

The third academic month reveals growing power disparities from unequal hunting opportunities, and Michael must adapt his strategy to overcome both resource and social barriers.

### Cultivation Gap Emergence
- Significant power advancement for house-affiliated students following private hunts
- Michael noticeably behind despite starting the year at equal or higher levels
- Victoria and Julian show exceptional progress from high-quality core processing
- Previously sponsored common-born students demonstrate improved cultivation
- Faculty concerned by widening gap between house-backed and independent students

### Strategic Response
- Michael recognizes need for alliance-building to overcome institutional barriers
- Identifies students who failed to secure or maintain house sponsorship
- Approaches disaffected students with unique value proposition beyond wealth
- Emphasizes merit-based team structure that rewards performance over politics
- Uses frustration from Month 4 to fuel more determined team-building approach

- Both Michael and Victoria qualify along with Julian and other rivals
- Major opportunity for Michael to close advancement gap
- Critical moment for validating his independent team approach

## Month 6: Advanced Combat Class Special Hunt

The third expedition represents a significant escalation in both opportunity and danger, culminating in the critical soul binding event.

### Elite Expedition Structure
